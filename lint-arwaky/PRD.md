# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Auto Linter MCP Server v1.10.2

---

## 1. Product Overview

**Name**: Auto Linter
**Type**: MCP Server + CLI Tool
**Version**: 1.10.2
**License**: MIT
**Language**: Python >= 3.12

Auto Linter is an autonomous multi-language linting, type-checking, and
architectural rule auditing tool. It runs as both an MCP server and CLI tool.

Uses `mcp.server.fastmcp.FastMCP` for the MCP server interface.
Connects to system for secure command execution.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

Software projects accumulate quality debt silently. Developers lack:

- Automated pre-commit quality gates that run without configuration
- Architectural enforcement that prevents cross-layer violations
- Unified interface across multiple linters (Ruff, MyPy, Bandit, ESLint...)
- Both human-accessible CLI and AI-agent-accessible MCP tools from one codebase
- Easy setup for community/open-source distribution

Auto Linter addresses all five.

## 3. AI Agent Value

Auto Linter is designed to integrate with AI coding agents through its MCP interface, providing:

| Value Driver               | Description                            |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Agent Autonomy**   | Agent operates without human oversight |
| **Multi-Agent Sync** | 2+ agents share job registry           |
| **Self-Healing**     | Agent auto-fixes detected issues       |
| **24/7 Quality**     | Agent enforces rules continuously      |

## 7. Architecture

### 7.1 Domain Model (6 Domains)

```
src/
  agent/           -- Lifecycle, orchestration, pipeline, DI container
  capabilities/    -- Thinking logic: analysis, formatting, architecture
  contract/        -- Interfaces, traits, protocols
  infrastructure/  -- Adapters: ruff, mypy, eslint, transports
  surfaces/        -- Interfaces: CLI (Click), MCP (FastMCP)
  taxonomy/        -- Shared types: value objects, models, errors
```

### 7.2 Dependency Rules

```
agent          -> taxonomy, contract, infrastructure, capabilities  
surfaces       -> taxonomy, contract, agent  
capabilities   -> taxonomy, contract   
infrastructure -> taxonomy, contract  
contract       -> taxonomy, contract              
taxonomy       -> taxonomy                                      
```

### 7.3 MCP Server Architecture

Uses `mcp.server.fastmcp.FastMCP` with register-function based tool registration.
Tool registry is split into granular modules:

```
mcp_server_entry.py     -- creates FastMCP, registers tools
mcp_tools_registry.py   -- bridges modules, calls register_*()
mcp_execute_command.py  -- execute_command tool (Direct execution)
mcp_command_catalog.py  -- list_commands + read_skill_context
mcp_job_management.py   -- check_status (cancel moved to CLI: auto-lint cancel)
mcp_health_check.py     -- health_check
mcp_status_client.py    -- Status check client
```

### 7.4 Agentic Engineering System (AES) v1.9.4

Severity levels and their point penalty per finding:

| Severity | Penalty | Description                                   |
| -------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| LOW      | -1      | Minor style or naming issue                   |
| MEDIUM   | -2      | Structural concern, barrel/import patterns    |
| HIGH     | -3      | Architecture violation, mandatory requirement |
| CRITICAL | -5      | Bypass markers, dead inheritance, layer fraud |

Total score starts at 100.0 and is deducted per finding. If any CRITICAL finding exists, compliance fails regardless of score.

**AES006 Primitive Policy (v1.9.4)**: Value Object enforcement is **granular per layer**:

- `contract` and `taxonomy(entity|error|event)` → `no_primitives: true` (strict)
- `infrastructure`, `capabilities`, `surfaces` → `no_primitives: false` (adapter layers may use primitives as supporting types)

See separate [AES Rules Document](docs/AES_RULES.md) for full rule definitions, codes, and violation messages.
